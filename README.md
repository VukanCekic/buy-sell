# E-Commerce Microservice Web App

Welcome to the E-Commerce Microservice Web App project. This project aims to create a platform similar to eBay, where users can buy and sell new and used products. The application is built using serverless architecture on AWS. Below, you will find information on setting up and running the project, system design, and more.

- **AWS Lambda**: For serverless computing.
- **Amazon API Gateway**: To create and manage APIs.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: For NoSQL database storage.
- **AWS S3**: For storing product images.
- **Node.js / Typescript**: For backend logic.
- **React.js / Angular**: For the frontend (if applicable).

## Database Design

The database design is based on the requirements of the platform and will be documented in detail in the database design document.

## Service Endpoints / API Design

The API design is based on RESTful principles and will be documented in detail in the API documentation.
