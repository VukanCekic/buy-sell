# E-Commerce Microservice Web App

Welcome to the E-Commerce Microservice Web App project. This project aims to create a platform similar to eBay, where users can buy and sell new and used products. The application is built using serverless architecture on AWS. Below, you will find information on setting up and running the project, system design, and more.
